# How to Share "Cows & Bulls" with a Friend

Since this is a web application, the easiest way to share it without sharing the code is to "deploy" it to a free website hosting service.

## Step 1: Deploying the App (The Easier Way - Vercel)

You can use **Vercel** to host your app for free. It's very popular for apps built like this one.

1.  **Create a GitHub Repository**:
    *   Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository (you can name it `cows-and-bulls`).
    *   Upload your project code to this repository. You can do this by dragging the files or using the command line if you know how.

2.  **Deploy on Vercel**:
    *   Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up (you can use your GitHub account).
    *   Click "Add New..." -> "Project".
    *   Select the `cows-and-bulls` repository you just created.
    *   Vercel will detect it's a "Vite" project. Just click **Deploy**.
    *   Wait a minute, and Vercel will give you a link (e.g., `https://cows-and-bulls.vercel.app`).

**That's it! This link is your game.**

## Step 2: Sharing with a Friend

1.  Send the link (e.g., `https://cows-and-bulls.vercel.app`) to your friend via iMessage or WhatsApp.

## Step 3: Installing on iPhone (For your Friend)

Tell your friend to follow these steps to install it as an app:

1.  Open the link in **Safari** on their iPhone.
2.  Tap the **Share** button (the square with an arrow pointing up) at the bottom of the screen.
3.  Scroll down and tap **Add to Home Screen**.
4.  They will see the "Cows & Bulls" icon we created. Tap **Add**.

Now the game will appear on their home screen just like a regular App Store app! They can play it offline, and it will look full-screen without the browser bars.
